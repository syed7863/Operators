Operators are characters in programming and mathematics that represent specific actions or processes. They are the building blocks of programming languages and are used to perform a variety of tasks, including: 
Arithmetic calculations: Operators like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication, division (/), integer division (DIV), and remainder (MOD) perform mathematical calculations on values. 
Assigning values: Operators can assign values to variables. 
Making decisions: Operators can make decisions based on conditions. 
Logical operations: Operators like "&&" represent logical functions. 
Extracting information: Operators can extract information, such as a year from a date.
